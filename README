pjs4iPad lets you create Processing.js apps that can be added to the
iPad's home screen. Each app includes a simple code editor so you can edit
the code. Offline support is included through the user of the offline
application cache and local storage.

If you click Save & Run, and then hit the + button, you can add the
program to the home screen. Before you can go offline, you need to run it
from the home screen and use it (tap Edit, then tap Save & Run). That
makes sure all the files are pulled down into the offline app cache. Once
you've done that, you can go offline and edit your code and save it.
